# Steam Haptics Singer

This project is a fork of [Roboron3042's SteamControllerSinger](https://github.com/Roboron3042/SteamControllerSinger) which is a fork of [Pila's SteamControllerSinger](https://gitlab.com/Pilatomic/SteamControllerSinger). It attempts to add Deck compatibility but is, at the moment, not that good.

I gotta say, I'm no expert and barely know how this thing works, but I hope to actually make some improvements if possible :).

## How To

1. Turn on your Steam Controller or Steam Deck
2. Drag the midi file onto steam-haptics-singer executable
3. When prompted, press ENTER
4. Enjoy!

### Where can I find midi songs?

Songs ready to play can be found in the original guy's [personal collection](https://mega.nz/#F!BWpEWKzB!r7WPw5bZ_domN4pk-FJsjg) (as he called it). Otherwise, you can just try a MIDI and see what happens (most of the time it won't work well).

### Usage from command prompt:
	steam-haptics-singer [-r][-l DEBUG_LEVEL] [-i INTERVAL] [-c RECLAIM_PERIOD] MIDI_FILE

	-i INTERVAL argument to choose player sleep interval (in microseconds). Lower generally means better song fidelity, but higher cpu usage, and at some point goidn lower won't improve any more. Default value is 10000

	-l DEBUG_LEVEL argument to choose libusb debug level. Default is 0, no debug output. max is 4, max verbosity output
	
	-r to enable repeat mode, which plays continously (restart the song when finished)
	
	-c RECLAIM_PERIOD will change the default reclaiming period (2 seconds). A greater period will reduce notes hanging, but will also increase the probability of losing the control of the controller, depending on the song. All songs are known to fail with reclaim period over 5. After a failed attempt, you will need to reconnect the controller.

### Midi files tips:

Midi files may need to be edited with a software such as [MidiEditor](https://www.midieditor.org/) to be correctly played with Steam Haptics Singer following the next tips:

* Notes from midi channel 0 are played on right haptic
* Notes from midi channel 1 are played on left haptic
* Notes from others channels are ignored
* **Avoid multiple notes active at the same time on the same channel**, since haptic actuators can only play one note at the time.

## CHANGELOG

[My v1.9 Build :> (EXCLUSIVE)]
* Badly added Deck support. No improvements.

[v1.8]
* User can now define the reclaim period with -c option.

[v1.7]
* Fixed music stopped playing after a few seconds

[v1.6]
* Fixed major bugs in playback algorithm

[v1.5]
* Changed debug level argument from -d to -l
* Added -r argument to enable demo mode
* Enhanced arguments parsing
* Does not rely on Steam Controller duration anymore
* Updated note display
* Now stops playing when interrupting the process ( on Ctrl+C )

[v1.4]
* Fixed a bug in MIDI librairie that would compute a null duration for notes when ON event and previous OFF event had the same timetick

[v1.3]
* Added -iINTERVAL argument
* Added -dDEBUG_LEVEL argument 

[v1.2]
* Fixed being stuck on "Command error" when disconnecting controller while playing. Now continue playing (even if keep failing)
* Removed the now deprecated 20ms note duration reduction

## Compiling

You will need libusb(-dev) and pkgconf. If you have them, just type `make`.
